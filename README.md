## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Installing

Before getting started, some prerequisites must be installed via `pip`:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

GPU-based version was tested on `cuda 9.0`.

## Running the tests

[TODO]
